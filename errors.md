# Errors
All errors will be displayed to either the Controller or the Brain, and are preceded by the **[ERR]** tag.

## ICTS
**ICTS** expands out to mean "Invalid Control Scheme". It means that inside the code, the current control scheme was invalid.
Inside the code, there's an enum with two values to control the current driving scheme: **Tank**, and **Arcade**. When displaying this to the LCD, if neither of these are detected, this will be displayed.

### How to Resolve
Restart the Code is the only way for the user to fix this. Technically, this error **should not be possible**, but anything can happen in the code ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## More to come... (hopefully not actually)
Please open an Issue if you spot a bug!
