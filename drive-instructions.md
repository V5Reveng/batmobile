## The Driving Control Schemes
There are two driving control schemes available for use with the batmobile: **Tank** or **Arcade**.

### Tank Style
Tank Style driving, as the name implies, drives similiary to how a tank would be *imagined*\* to drive. 

**Instructions:**
- The **left** analog stick (Axis 3 on v4 controllers) controls the *left* side of the batmobile (the two left motors)

- The **right** analog stick (Axis 2 on v4 controllers) controls the *right* side of the batmobile (the two right motors)

Together, the driver has many options when it comes to controlling the batmobile. To **move forward**, simply push both sticks together forward. To **move backward**, push both sticks together backward.

> In Tank Drive, it is imperative that any control requiring all driving motors to be in unison must be controlled together. Even a slight difference between the two sides can cause the batmobile to go off course.

With tank drive, one cannot use the left or right sides on either analog stick (axes 4 and 1, respectively). Turning must be done in place, by pushing the sticks **opposite** to each other.
- To turn clockwise (right), push the **left** stick *forward* and the **right** stick *backward*
- To turn counter-clockwise (left), push the **right** stick *forward* and the **left** stick *backward*

That's tank drive! It is the most simple and intuitive control scheme out there, and is common in most batmobiles. However, most of us have grown up playing video games that use a different style of movement. That's **Arcade Control**, which we cover next!

<h6>*Tanks are probably more nuanced in their driving than this batmobile. What we mean is that turning is similar to how a tank turns.</h6>

### Arcade Style

Video Games have a large impact on all of us, and most likely, we've all tried our hand at a game once or twice, if not more. Arcade Style Driving attempts to replicate this control scheme. But **be warned!** Arcade style is a *simpler* control style to Tank Style, and abstracts away many controls from the driver.

In tank driving, the driver has control over the left and right side of the bot. Turning can be done in place. In Arcade style, the use instead must turn while moving, and controls the entire batmobile, and all four driving motors.

**Instructions:**
- Use the **left** analog stick (axis 3 on v4) to drive the *entire* batmobile *forward*
    - Push the **left** stick **forward** to go forward, and push it **backwards** to go **backward**
- Use the **right** analog stick (axis 1 on v4) to turn the batmobile left or right
    - Push the **right** stick to the **left** to turn to the left, and push it to the **right** to turn to the right

To move forward, the driver only needs to push the **left** analog stick *forward*. To go backward, the drive needs to push the **left** stick *backward*.

To turn, the batmobile must be in motion, driving either forwards or backwards. Then, push the **right** analog stick to the **left** (to turn *left*) or to the **right** (to turn *right*). When driving *forwards*, the **left** direction will turn *left*, and the **right** direction will turn *right*. **When driving *backwards*, the right direction will turn *left*, and the left direction will turn *right*.**

### Changing Control Schemes

The current control scheme is displayed on the LCD of the V5 *master* controller. "Tank" refers to Tank Drive, and "Arcade" refers to Arcade Drive. Press the **Y** Button on the controller to change between the two. They are **toggle** switches.
> The goal of this customizability has two distinct reasons:
> - Flexibility for the driver, as the driver can choose their preferred control style (altough tank is almost always preferred)
> - Ability to change the *use* of the bot, from Outreach to Competition and back
>   - In competitions, tank drive is ususally preferred, and has more benefits
>   - In outreach events to younger children, arcade drive is often preferred due to its ease-of-use, and widespread usage in video games
